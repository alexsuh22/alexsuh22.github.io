			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>I was born on December 12, 2001. I was born in a very <br>Korean family, but English was my first language.
			I started speaking English when I was <br>three years old and Korean when I was three. I was raised as a smart kid and <br>attended the very well-known school of Beverly Vista.
			I was one of the smartest kids in my elementary years, but middle school became a struggle. Things started to get <br>hard both in and out of school.
			Life wasn't a Utopia anymore. I had to grow up. I finished <br>6th grade weak, but in 7th grade, I came back. However, I started to drop in <br>academics in the 8th grade.
			My mom started to grow more strict and assumed I <br>dallied all day. I tried and tried, but ended 8th as a failure. 9th grade, things started <br>to turn around. 
			I had my first tutor and he was great. He taught me all <br>my subjects perfectly and I passed 9th grade with a 5.0 GPA. Not only was <br>I elated, but my mom as well. 
			The rest of the years played out well as I joined many <br>extracurriculum activities and taught Koreans in Korea how to <br>speak English. I would love to work for you guys here at Google and hope you <br>guys accept. Thank you very much.
